These are some of the LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks problem-solving tasks as part of the placement training sessions conducted by our trainer at CipherSchools. These exercises covered a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms topics. Regular practice of these problems helped me strengthen my logical thinking, improve coding efficiency, and gain confidence in solving interview-level questions within time constraints. This repository serves as a collection of the solutions I worked on during the training, reflecting my continuous learning and dedication toward improving my problem-solving and technical skills for placements.
